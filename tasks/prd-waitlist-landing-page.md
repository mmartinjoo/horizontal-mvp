# PRD: Horizontal Waitlist Landing Page

## 1. Introduction/Overview

Create a minimalist, conversion-focused waitlist landing page for Horizontal - a knowledge search platform that connects all team applications into one smart knowledge base. The page will capture developer interest and measure product-market fit before full product development.

**Target Audience**: Development teams at fast-moving startups
**Primary Goal**: Convert developer visitors to waitlist signups
**Secondary Goal**: Validate product interest and measure conversion metrics

## 2. Goals

- **Primary**: Maximize visitor-to-signup conversion rate among developer audience
- **Validation**: Measure genuine interest in the unified knowledge search concept
- **Analytics**: Track visitor behavior and conversion funnel performance
- **Positioning**: Establish Horizontal as the "everything app" for team knowledge

### Success Criteria
- Landing page loads in under 2 seconds
- Clear value proposition communicated within 5 seconds of page load
- Single-page design with minimal cognitive load
- Email capture form with validation
- Responsive design across all devices

## 3. User Stories

- **As a developer visiting the page**, I want to immediately understand what Horizontal does so that I can decide if it solves my team's knowledge management problems
- **As a problem-aware developer**, I want to see how Horizontal connects my existing tools so that I understand the solution's scope
- **As a potential early adopter**, I want to join the waitlist with minimal friction so that I can be notified when the product launches
- **As a team lead**, I want to understand the productivity benefits so that I can evaluate if this tool would help my team

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Messaging
1. The page must emphasize "Connect all your apps together" as the primary value proposition
2. Must highlight "Search in everything" as the key functionality
3. Must communicate time-saving benefits ("Don't waste time scanning 5+ different apps")
4. Must position Horizontal as the "everything app for your entire team"

### 4.2 Page Structure
1. Hero section with clear headline and primary CTA
2. Problem/solution explanation section
3. App integration visualization or list
4. Email capture form with single CTA button
5. Social proof or testimonial (if available)

### 4.3 Email Capture
1. Single email input field with validation
2. Clear "Join Waitlist" or similar CTA button
3. Success state confirmation after submission
4. Error handling for invalid emails
5. Email storage in backend system

### 4.4 Design Requirements
1. Light theme with minimalist aesthetic
2. Colorful but restrained color palette
3. Startup-friendly visual style (not enterprise)
4. Mobile-responsive design
5. Clean typography and generous whitespace

### 4.5 Technical Implementation
1. Vue 3 SPA application in `/frontend` folder
2. Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Form submission to backend API
4. Analytics tracking for conversions
5. Performance optimization for fast loading

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **No product demonstration**: No actual search functionality or app integrations
- **No pricing information**: Focus solely on waitlist capture
- **No detailed feature explanations**: Keep messaging high-level and benefit-focused
- **No user accounts**: Simple email capture only
- **No enterprise features**: Maintain startup aesthetic and messaging
- **No multiple pages**: Single-page landing experience only

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Visual Style References
Based on provided examples:
- **Rows.com**: Colorful badges, clear hierarchy, prominent CTA
- **ProjectionLab**: Bold headlines with color accents, clean layout
- **Cleanvoice**: Strong value proposition, social proof, simple form
- **Linear**: Dark elegance with clear typography, professional yet approachable

### 6.2 Key Visual Elements
1. **Headline**: Large, bold typography with selective color highlighting
2. **App Icons**: Visual representation of connected applications (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
3. **CTA Button**: Prominent, contrasting color for email capture
4. **Layout**: Centered content with generous margins
5. **Color Palette**: Primary brand color with 2-3 accent colors

### 6.3 Mobile Considerations
1. Stack layout for mobile screens
2. Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px)
3. Readable font sizes (minimum 16px for inputs)
4. Optimized image loading

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Frontend Implementation
- **Framework**: Vue 3 Composition API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Build**: Vite development server
- **Deployment**: Static hosting compatible

### 7.2 Backend Integration
- **API Endpoint**: POST to `/api/waitlist` for email capture
- **Validation**: Server-side email validation and duplicate checking
- **Storage**: Database table for waitlist emails with timestamps
- **Analytics**: Track form submissions and source attribution

### 7.3 Performance Requirements
- **Loading Speed**: Under 2 seconds initial load
- **Bundle Size**: Minimize JavaScript payload
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with proper formats
- **CDN**: Consider CDN for static assets

### 7.4 Analytics Integration
- **Conversion Tracking**: Form submission events
- **User Behavior**: Scroll depth, time on page
- **Source Attribution**: Track referral sources from developer audience
- **A/B Testing**: Prepare for headline/CTA variations

## 8. Success Metrics

### 8.1 Primary Metrics
- **Conversion Rate**: Visitors to email signups (target: >15%)
- **Signup Volume**: Total waitlist registrations
- **Traffic Quality**: Average time on page (target: >30 seconds)

### 8.2 Secondary Metrics
- **Page Performance**: Load time under 2 seconds
- **Mobile Conversion**: Mobile vs desktop conversion rates
- **Source Performance**: Conversion by referral source

- **Message Resonance**: Time spent reading key sections
- **User Feedback**: Qualitative feedback if collection mechanism added

## 9. Open Questions

### 9.1 Content Strategy
- Should we include specific app logos/integrations or keep it generic?
- What's the optimal headline length for developer audience?
- Should we mention the founder's developer audience of 20k?

### 9.2 Technical Decisions
- Do we need email verification for waitlist signups?
- Should the form include additional fields (company, role)?
- What analytics platform should we integrate?

### 9.3 Design Refinements
- What's the preferred color scheme within the "colorful but restrained" guideline?
- Should we include any product mockups or keep it completely conceptual?
- How prominent should social proof elements be?

### 9.4 Launch Strategy
- What's the expected traffic volume from the developer audience?
- Should we prepare for mobile-heavy traffic patterns?
- Do we need rate limiting on the email capture endpoint?
