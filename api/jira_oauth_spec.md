# Jira integration

I want to integrate Jira into Horizontal.

The goeal is to be able to call their REST API and fetch issues, comments, projects on behalf of users.

Please add the basic intgration that implements OAuth auhtorization to their API. Handle token, redirects, callbacks, etc. After you're ready I want to be able to just simply call their API. I already added the necessary env variables to the .env file.

This task ONLY INCLUDES API-related tasks. Don't touch the frontend.
