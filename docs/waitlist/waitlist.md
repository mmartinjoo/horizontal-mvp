# Landing page for a waitlist

Build a waitlist landing page for Horizontal.
I'm going to drive my developer follower to this page where they can join the waitlist.

The product doesn't exist yet, I just want to measure if they are interest at all.

My goals:
- Convert as many visitors as possible
- Find out if they are interested in the idea at all
- Measure visitors and conversion rate

Most visitors are in the problem-aware stage, but they might not be aware of the solutions.

The page should emphasize the following message:
- Connect all your apps together
- Search in everything
- Don't waste time by scanning 5+ different apps for answers
- Horizontal is the "everything app" for your entire team

Here are some landing pages that I like:
- rows.com
- breakdance.com
- projectionlab.com
- cleanvoice.ai
- linear.app

I want a page that is:
- Minimalist
- Colorful but not too much
- Doesn't have an "enterprise" feeling, but looks like a cool startup
- Has light theme

## Tech stack

- The page should be served by Vue3 SPA app in the frontend folder.
- Please use tailwind CSS.
- DO NOT USE TypeScript
- Don't write tests
- Don't run linters
