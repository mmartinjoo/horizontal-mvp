# Horizontal

Horizontal is a search platform for engineering teams. It integrates with 10+ tools such as 
- Gmail
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Calendar
- Notion
- Trello
- Linear
- Jira
- Slack
- AWS S3
- etc

and provides one search platform for all of them.

In seconds, you can find relevant information to your question that is spread across multiple documents, tickets, conversations.

## The problem
Companies use lots of different applications to:
- Store information
- Communicate
- Manage work

These applications contain lots of knowledge, conversation, and other important information.
I'm talking about apps like:
- Gmail
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Calendar
- Notion
- Trello
- Linear
- Jira
- Slack
- AWS S3
- etc

The problem is that it's really hard to get information and knowlegde because it's spread across so many different applications.

For example, today, I had a meeting in my calendar with a guy called "Dunsin." The event's name was: "Dunsin x Martin"
I had no idea what was the topic of the meeting or who Dunsin was.

Another example. Today I set up HTTPS with certbot for an application that runs in a docker compose stack. I already did this in the past, and I know I documentes the process. But I had no idea where the document was. So I had to figure out the entire process again.

## The solution
Horizontal is an application that has all the knowledge about a team's work.
It integrates all applications and gathers every piece of information and stores it in a central database.

Whenever someone has a question, such as, "who is Dunsin and why do I have a meeting with him?" they can just ask the app and it answers: "Dunsin is a PHP developer who works on an event scheduling application. You had conversation with him in Email and you aggreed to have a 60-min meeting to help him optimize the performance of his application."

Or they can ask it "how the hell do I set up certbot in docker compose stack?" and it answers with my documentation that they created a year ago in a Google Drive document.

Whenever they ask a question, it scans all the records and answers my question in the best possible way and points me to the original direction of the information. For example, if it lives if a Google Drive doc it gives me the link so I can check it out.

## The target audience

Since I have an audience of 20,000 developers, first I want to target development teams.
That means I'll integrate GitHub into the app, so it can understand the company's source code and PRs as well.

For example, a developer can ask a question like "Why do we have this weird workaround in feature XYZ?"
And the app will show:
- GitHub PR comments
- Slack conversations
- Emails
- Linear tickets

Where they discussed why the workaround was necessary.

So I want to target developer teams at first. The best customer would be a smaller, fast-moving startup where things are not that organized yet.

Another great use case is something like this:
- A critical bug appears in production
- You need to find similar issues from the past
- You dig through Jira tickets, GitHub issues, and Slack conversations
- You spend an hour recreating context that already existed

Users would be able to ask a simple question like: "What was the root cause of the previous 'mysql server has gone away' error in prod?"

And Horizontal would answer like this:
"""
Your team had this issue on the 15th of April. The `max_allowed_packet` value was exceeded bacause of a very large `INSERT` in the bulk create API.

Participants:

Ben created the issues
Tom contributed the fixes
Peter merged the pull request


GitHub PR #247 - "Refactor bulk create API" [Link to PR]
Slack #engineering - Thread from April 15 [Link to Slack conversation]

## Use cases

Use case: Search
Capability: search across 10+ different sources using natural language
Benefit: incredibly fast

Use case: Connected insights
Capability: 
    Visualize your information as a connected graph. When you search with Horizontal it doesn't just provide a summary and data sources. It also creates a beautiful graph that shows how your information is connected.
    For example, let's say you have a feature in your application but you're not sure why.
    You can ask Horizontal: "why do we have feature X?"
    It will find the related:
        - PRs
        - Tickets
        - Drive docs
        - Slack conversation

    From the Slack conversation it knows which product manager or support staff, or other stakeholders participated with ideas and requests.
    From this relationship, you'll understand that have this feature because of Mike from sales suggested it to oyu based on a customer feedback.
Benefit: in a second you can see the relation between your slack conversations, Drive docs, Linear tickets, GitHub PR. See which team member contributed to which part.

Use case: Recall past decisions
Capability: read a quick summary about a decision that was made based on 4 Slack conversations, 3 Google Docs, etc
Benefit: makes it really easy to recall past decision with all the sources

Use case: Onboarding
Capability: you can use Horizontal to onboard new developers way faster than you would normally do. Horizontal will be their mentor and answers all of their questions.
Benefit: save valuable engineering hours when bringing new developers into your team.

## The feedback

This is the feedback on the idea from a potential customer:

Me: What‚Äôs your biggest challenge when managing knowledge across tools like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Jira, Email, etc.?
Potential customer: I think the biggest challenge i have would be switching between different tabs, apps and screens to get work done.

Me: If you had a magic wand, what would you wish for to solve this problem?
Potential customer: Focus. An all-in-one solution would let me stay in a single app that connects all my tools, so I don‚Äôt have to waste time switching between screens, apps, and dealing with team permissions .

Me: If a tool could integrate ALL your apps into ONE smart knowledge base, how valuable would that be to you?
Potential customer: 4 out of 5

Me: What specific features would you expect from such a tool?
Potential customer:
1. Unified search across all teamsüòã
2. Link sharing (something like creating a private link where specific members can access only certain things)
3. Great UI, minimalistic and simple enough to use

Me: What would make you hesitant to use a tool like this?
Potential customer: Security, i wouldn't love a situation where my account would be hacked and i would lose access to all linked apps/tools

Me: Would you pay for a tool like this?
Potential customer: Yes

Me: If yes, how much would you expect to pay per month?
Potential customer: $10

Some questions that potential customers would ask from a system like this:
- What did I discuss with Samuel regarding Notifications last week?
- Why does feature X not do XYZ yet?
- Where is our coding style guideline file?
- I need our logo
- Did we solve all customer complaints today?
- What was the root cause of the last ‚ÄúMySQL server has gone away‚Äù error?
