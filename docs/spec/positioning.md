# Positioning

The goal of this document is to answer these three questions:

- What is Horizontal?  
- Who is it for?  
- Why is it better?

# Who

## Workflows

At the end of the day, all B2B software is workflow software. There’s a workflow that needs to be digitized, modernized, sped up, etc.

If a team doesn’t use tasks, docs, and communication, Horizontal is no good for them. There’s no workflow to make better.

**The positioning of Horizontal should be rooted in the workflow it solves.**

To understand horizontal, let’s go through a product development workflow.

Before development begins, product managers, team leads, and other stakeholders are responsible for:

- Defining business goals  
- Transforming them into product requirements  
- Drafting a high-level specification  
- Defining milestones and high-level goals  
- Creating detailed PRDs or specs for lower-level tasks  
- Creating tasks and user stories  
- Defining sprints from tasks

Once the product is defined from a business point of view, engineering teams can do more technical preparation:

- Defining architectural requirements  
- Making tech stack-related decisions  
- Designing data models

And then engineering teams can start the daily work: 

- Picking tasks for the next sprints  
- Adding more context to tasks  
- Estimating them  
- Writing code  
- Creating PRs  
- Running CI/CD pipelines  
- Testing  
- Deploying to production

If we zoom out, we can come up with groups and workflows like these:  


For example, AWS is a product that handles your entire deployment and production stuff. JetBrains is a product that helps you write code.

Products that solve bigger workflows, such as Jira (and its entire ecosystem), have:

- Higher ACV (average customer value)  
- Longer sales cycle  
- Sales-lead growth

Products that solve smaller workflows, such as Google Drive, can:

- Lower ACV  
- Faster sales cycle  
- Product-lead growth

Other examples would be (outside of development):

- Calendly \-\> small workflow (scheduling meetings)  
- HubSpot \-\> large workflow (an entire marketing/sales platform)

There are products that pick one specific “thing” that occurs in multiple workflows (or groups). Slack is an awesome example. You need to communicate with other people, whether you are:

- Developing a new feature  
- Fixing a bug  
- Deploying to prod

Drive and Confluence are other examples of this. You need to document stuff in every workflow.

### 

### Horizontal’s position in the workflow scale

We don’t want to own entire workflows or categories.

**Horizontal is about knowledge management in any workflow.** We unify knowledge management across all tools.

It’s one small step in many different workflows.

Either you’re about to:

- Start a new feature from scratch  
- Fix a bug  
- Or change something in your production architecture

You need to access knowledge and information about the past.

In one sentence, Horizontal’s position from a workflow perspective:

**Unified and easy access to all your team’s knowledge.**

# 

## Competitive alternatives

Often, a competitor of a product is a product from a different category.

For example:

- Slack’s main competitor was email. Not another IM application.  
- Loom’s competitor was simply having too many meetings

The main competitors of Horizontal:

- Searching for information in Slack threads  
  - Going back to 7-day-old Slack threads  
  - Re-creating the context of a specific feature development that happened months ago and remembering why certain decisions were made  
- Manually finding/browsing files on Google Drive  
- Asking questions on Slack and waiting for the answer  
  - Questions that are answered somewhere in your 5 different tools

For teams that don’t use a better solution right now, these are the competitors.

Of course, there are other competitors such as:

- Glean  
- GoSearch  
- Notion AI  
- ChatGPT Enterprise, Claude for Work

These are great products, but most of them focuses on enterprises.

As far as I know, most startups and small teams don’t use tools like this.

**So, Horizontal will be positioned as an alternative to “manually searching through Drive, Slack, Jira, Confluence, Email”**

## 

## Problem

The third leg of product positioning is a specific problem that you are solving which is experienced by customers and they are aware of it.

The main pain points experienced by potential customers:

- The awful search bar on Google Drive  
- Disorganized and hard-to-follow folder structures on Google Drive  
- Not able to search files based on context on Drive  
- Too many Slack channels and threads which means it’s hard to understand and especially hard to search in.  
- Too many Jira issues  
- Bad onboarding experience

The problem is not in competitive products. The problem is the workflow itself. The manual search across 5+ different systems.

## Customer profile

With Horizontal, we want to target smaller companies, and early-stage startups. Mainly for two reasons:

- They don’t like overcomplicated enterprise software  
- I have access to some of them

Horizontal will be a cool, startup-friendly (developer-friendly) tool.

In terms of customer profile, we want to go after:  
**Role**

- Lead developers, CTOs  
- Individual developers (who work in teams)

**Department**

- Engineering team  
- One of the competitive advantages of Horizontal can be that it is targeted to engineers specifically

**Headcount**

- Smaller companies with 1-50 people mainly

Based on these three legs we can answer the first question.

**Who is it for?**

| Workflow | Competitive alternative | Problem |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| *people who are…* | *now using…* | *which causes problems because…* |
| **Working a lot with information on a daily basis** | **Manual search across different tools** | **It’s annoying, hard, and easy to forget things** |

# What

The next question to answer is “What is Horizontal?”

There are two options when putting a product into a category:

- Put it in a well-known mature category  
- Put it in an emerging, “sexy” category

Adcvantages and disadvantages of putting it in a mature category:

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
| :---- | :---- |
| Very little education needed | More competition |
| Faster sales cycle | More price anchoring |
| Certainty about the market | Risks negative association |

## Adcvantages and disadvantages of putting it in a new category:

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
| :---- | :---- |
| Less competition | Need education |
| Less price anchoring | Slower sales cycles |
| Avoids negative associations | Risk the category won’t materialize |
| Headstart on distribution |  |

Well-established categories in this space:

- Enterprise search  
- Workplace search  
- Enterprise Knowledge Management (EKM)

These are all focusing on enterprise. Which, I want to avoid at all cost.

Emerging categories:

- “Work AI” \- it’s not really a category, but Glean started positioning themselves as “Work AI platform”  
- AI knowledge platform

I’m not sure if I like the idea of positioning it as an “AI” product. In the engineering space, everything is AI now, for example:

- Notion is now “the AI workspace that works for you” meanwhile it’s a bloated shit  
- Zapier is now “the most connected AI orchestration platform” meanwhile people use it to save stuff into a Google Sheet when they receive an email  
- Slack is now “the AI work management & productivity tool”

We’ll find out what my audience thinks about this: [https://x.com/mmartin\_joo/status/1962577477902934428](https://x.com/mmartin_joo/status/1962577477902934428)

As I see it, there aren’t many good options. Some ideas without “enterprise” and “AI”:

- Unified search platform  
- Unified access to your team’s knowledge  
- One search to rule them all  
- The knowledge app for engineering teams  
- The search engine for your engineering team  
- The search platform for your engineering team

One potential problem with the word “knowledge” is that developers might focus on old-school knowledge base systems such as DocuWiki, MediaWiki, OpenKM. Or some product that they don’t like, such as Atlassian Confluence.

Another problem that “Unified” might sound like an enterprise term. For example, Salesforce announced “Unified knowledge” \- [https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/unified-knowledge-news/](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/unified-knowledge-news/)

Salesforce is famous about being bloated and enterprise.

So for now, Horizontal is a

**Search Platform**

# Why

The last question is: “why is it better?” “why is it different?”  
   
There are two types of differentiation:

- By degree: “we do X but faster, better, cheaper, etc”  
  - For example, Superhuman. “A faster email experience”  
- Binary: “they do X, we do Y”  
  - For example, DuckDuckGo. “Google tracks you, we don’t”

We will use differentiation by degree since we’re going to market against manual search in many different tools not a specific competitor.

**With Horizontal you can search across 10+ different tools in seconds.**
